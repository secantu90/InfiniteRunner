- The animation standing requires a pingpong loop animation, this saves some sprites ( like example 1,2,3,4,3,2,1) 
- The jump animation need a pingpong animation to be completed 
- All standing and aerial shots needs a pingpong animation to back at standing pose
- the last 2 sprites of all standing shot animation must be repeated for constant fire
- the dash animation can be looped

These are just some notes. operation depends more than required by the developer. 
After taking the sprites you decide which you need and which are not
